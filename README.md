# popquiz
"Popquiz is a Ruby gem designed to ease and expedite the TDD(Test-Driven-Development) software development process. TDD relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first an (initially failing) automated test case is written that defines a desired improvement or new function. Then, the minimum amount of code is written to pass that test, and finally one refactors the new code to acceptable standards."
