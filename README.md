# popquiz ðŸš€
Popquiz is a Ruby gem designed to ease and expedite the TDD(Test-Driven-Development) software development process. It uses a CLI to generate base tests for your project in the rSpec DSL.

### First things first

run ```bundle install``` / ```bundle update```

#### Use it:

```rake pq:class``` - generate tests for your object

```rake pq:method``` - generate tests for your method

```rake pq:help``` - troubleshoot

##### Troubleshooting options available:

- ```about``` - Learn about the project, what it does, what is coming in the future
- ```attribute accessors``` - Learn what role attributes play in OOP, specifically, Ruby
- ```matchers``` - Learn about the syntax and API rSpec uses to test your project

##### The Future - Open to contribution
- Build out troubleshoot, cover test edge cases/gotchas
- File modularity, refactoring

**I'd like to keep this gem as minimal as possible**
